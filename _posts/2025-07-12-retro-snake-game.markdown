<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello and welcome! This week, there was a change of plans. Instead of starting with the Arduino kit, I decided to complete one more project for Shipwrecked: a Retro Snake Game.</p>

The change of plans happened because the flight cost €500 per person, and since my dad, my brother, and I were all going, the total would have been around €1,500, which is quite a lot. So, I decided to do one last project before diving into the Arduino: a Retro Snake Game!

Before I get into the details of my Snake Game, you might be wondering: why was my brother also coming to Boston? Was he also working on Shipwrecked? Well, no, he was working toward something similar called Neighborhood, where, if you complete a working app in 100 Hackatime hours, you earn a chance to go to San Francisco for as long as you want. You get to stay in houses with people your age. Neighborhood was designed for 16, 17, and 18 year-olds. The only catch? You had to code at least 40 hours a week to stay in SF.

The plan was for him to go from Boston to Neighborhood. The only problem? Well, Neighborhood was cancelled because too many teenagers met the requirements, and there weren’t enough houses to accommodate them all. In the end, the situation wasn’t ideal for the participants, and the best course of action was to cancel the program.

Since my brother already had a flight booked to Boston, he's now looking for alternatives, possibly trying to go for Shipwrecked instead. He had completed 45 out of the 100 required Hackatime hours for Neighborhood, but with the program canceled, he doesn't have much motivation.

I decided to do one more project because, for every hour you complete beyond the required 60 hours across four projects, you earn €10 toward your flight cost. To get those extra hours, I chose to build a Retro Snake Game. I spent the whole week working on it and only finished it yesterday. I logged 13 hours in total, which adds up to €130, though it still needs to be reviewed and accepted on the Shipwrecked page. Currently I have €32 from the little bits of hours from the other four projects. If I get my retro snake game accepted it would total to €162.

Over the next few weeks before Shipwrecked, I plan to focus on the Arduino kit. I’m also hoping to earn a bit more toward our flights, since Hackatime is compatible with KiCad, which means I can track hours spent on electronics projects for Shipwrecked. As I mentioned last week, I’ve got some great ideas that I can't wait to get into.
