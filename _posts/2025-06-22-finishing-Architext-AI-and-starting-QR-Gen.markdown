<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello and welcome! In this post, I'll take talk about the latest two weeks of my Shipwrecked adventure. From striving to hit 150 stars to receiving a message that changes it all!</p>

I left it off two weeks ago after just creating the Architext-AI project. I am proud to say that it is now complete, and I am quite pleased with the final result. The experience reminded me of some fun projects I built as a kid using Tkinter. It was quite nice for a young child to see an interesting UI with widgets and entry boxes, knowing he built them!

After finalizing the UI for the project, with some assistance from Claude and ChatGPT, I developed a Python script that sets the F5 key as the default key bind to automatically open the Architext-AI desktop app. You can find everything on my GitHub if you'd like to give it a try. I recorded my screen and created a short demo video, which I later converted into a GIF and uploaded to my GitHub. With that, I completed the 15-hour requirement for the second Shipwrecked project.

As I mentioned last week, Architext-AI is a straightforward message enhancer featuring a message input box and a prompt that serves as a guideline for the AI. I developed this small project because I need to complete four projects, each having at least 15 hours, with one achieving viral status to qualify for the Shipwrecked hackathon. During this time, my dad and I were actively posting on social media to see if the AI-PDF-Reader project (originally intended to go viral) could gain some traction. I am quite proud to report that, as of July 22, the AI-PDF-Reader has got 49 stars. It's still 101 stars short of the 150 needed to attend Shipwrecked, along with the completion of the other three projects of at least 15 hours. However, all of this seems less significant now because two days ago, I read a message that changed everything.

Architext-AI Demo:

The message read the following:

```
@channel this is biggest announcement EVER:
Finish your Shipwrecked project next week, earn a guaranteed invite (no need to go viral)!
If you complete your 4 projects with at least 15 hours each before next Sunday (June 29), we will waive the virality requirement for you and you’ll earn an invite to Shipwrecked!
You have until Sunday night to ship all your projects in The Bay to have your virality requirement waived!
```

This was instantly a game-changer. If the virality requirement were waived, it would save me a lot of effort—or would it? Achieving 30 hours in just over a week, when I read the message, would be no easy task. At the time, I had just finished the second project (Architext-AI) and was only halfway through. But, as with most things, I decided to give it a try. For the past two days, I have done practically nothing else but focus on accumulating as many hours as possible.

Now is probably a good time to mention the third project I've been working on for the past two days: the QR-Gen. This is a simple Tkinter project where you input text or a link, and it generates the corresponding QR code. I've also added a database feature to store past QR codes, and I think it’s looking nice. So far, I've accumulated 9 hours and 48 minutes of work, which isn't bad for two days.

I have 20 hours of work to complete in the next six days to secure a guaranteed invitation to Shipwrecked, and I intend on making every hour count!

I'm looking forward to sharing my journey and the final results of the QR-Gen project next week, along with my next project!
