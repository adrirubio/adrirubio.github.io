<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello, and welcome! In this post, I’ll be sharing what I’m currently working on—the ML Rover. This project involves building AI models for my Mars rover (Adeept Picar-B), combining machine learning with robotics for an exciting challenge! We are now up to day so consider this the weekly post.</p>

As of writing this post, the AI models for my Adeept Picar-B are still a work in progress—I only recently started working on them after finishing Mindful just a few days ago. Before diving into a new model, I like to take a methodical approach. I keep a small notebook where I jot down notes on various types of AI models.

Before starting a new project, I usually research the model, add relevant information to my notebook, and, if necessary, revisit my existing notes. Sometimes I already have a solid foundation, but I’ll often dig deeper to get a better understanding and add new insights. This way, when I begin building the model, I’m not starting from scratch and have a clearer idea of what I’m doing.
For example, the first model I’m building is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), so I researched what a CNN is and added the key details to my notebook. When working on the PyTorch models, I often refer to my notes in Org mode, which were created with the help of the PyTorch courses I took last year.
This process helps me stay organized and ensures I’m well-prepared before I start coding!

The rover I’ll be using for this project is the Adeept Picar-B, which I built a few years ago with help from my dad. I want to take a moment to say that my dad has been an incredible support throughout my coding journey. He taught me how to code when I was younger, and without his guidance and encouragement, I wouldn’t be where I am today. So, a huge thank you to my dad!
