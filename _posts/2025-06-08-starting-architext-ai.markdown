<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello and welcome! In this post, I wrapped up the AI PDF Reader by releasing a Windows version and started my next project — an AI writing assistant called Architext-AI.</p>

I started the week by creating a demo video for the AI PDF Reader, which is now embedded in  <a href="https://adrianrubio.org/blog/my-ai-pdf-reader-how-and-why-I-build-it/">last week's blog post.</a> I'm really happy with how the final version turned out. To wrap up the project, I released a Windows version and improved the README.
Hopefully, the AI PDF Reader can gain some traction, as my dad and I will be sharing it across various social media platforms. Our goal is to reach 150 stars on GitHub.

Next, I began brainstorming ideas for my next project. With some help from my dad, we came up with a simple Python program: using a predefined command, you can open a small window where write your message, and the AI will enhance it for you—improving clarity and overall quality. I think it would be something everyone would use.

Yesterday, I got started on the project. I planned out the structure and chose <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> for the GUI and the <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/">OpenAI SDK</a> for the AI capabilites. I set up all the necessary files, and now I’m focusing on building the Python GUI. Hopefully, by next week, I’ll have something that looks good and works smoothly.
