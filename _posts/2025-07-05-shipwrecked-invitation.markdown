<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello and welcome! The past two weeks have been a rollercoaster, but I’m proud to say that I’ve successfully completed 30 hours of work and built two full projects. All of my projects have been accepted, and I’m officially invited to Hack Club Shipwrecked!</p>

On Monday and Tuesday, I completed the QR-Gen project that I had previously started, and I’m quite proud of how it turned out. I also created a demo video of the finished product and updated the README with the full installation instructions and the demo.
Once the project was complete I put the project up for review.

One thing that kept me motivated during those long coding days was watching the leaderboard and seeing myself gradually climb up the ranks.

Next, I began working on my final project, Text-Lens. The goal of Text-Lens is to analyze any given text and present a variety of insights through visual tools like diagrams, graphs, and advanced statistics. It breaks down the text's structure and key characteristics to help users better understand and interpret written content. The destop app includes four core metrics: top words, sentence length analysis, punctuation breakdown, sentiment analysis, and some advaced stats.

As the deadline approached, I realized I was still a few hours short, and doubt started to appear in my mind. But I pushed through those final hours and ultimately submitted my final project just in time.

During the next week I read the <a href="https://ai-2027.com/">AI 2027</a> site and a few of the AI papers from my <a href="https://github.com/adrirubio/ai-learning/blob/main/reading-list.org">ai-learning</a> list while I waited for the projects to get accepted. I found the AI 2027 site incredibly interesting as it offers a look into a possible future. I highly recommend reading it for both its insights and perspective.

On Wednesday, Architext-AI and QR-Gen were accepted. At that point, I was just one project away from being invited to Shipwrecked.

Unfortunately, my final project was initially rejected because it wasn’t deployed using UV. So on Friday morning, I deployed the project on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/text-lens/">PyPI</a>. Now, you can install it using either 'pip install text-lens' or 'uv pip install text-lens', and run it with the command 'text-lens'.

Not long after, the project was accepted, and the following morning, I was officially invited to Shipwrecked!

Now, my parents and I will start preparing everything for Shipwrecked (flights, accomodation, etc.). Over the next few weeks, I plan to dive into Arduino to learn more about digital electronics and breadboarding. I already have a few exciting project ideas in mind, and I’m really looking forward to start work on them!
