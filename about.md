    Hi, I’m Adrian Rubio Punal. I’m 13 years old and really enjoy programming and AI. This blog is where I share my journey, what I’m learning, building, and discovering in the world of technology.

    I got into coding when my dad introduced me to programming. I liked the challenge of figuring things out, the satisfaction of fixing bugs, and the excitement of seeing my projects actually work.
